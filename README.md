# Flight-Deals-Project
  In this small project, I've attempted to handle the backend part of an application that sends messages to phones and emails with flight offers when used. In short, the cities I wish to visit are stored in a Spreadsheet, along with the maximum amount of money I'd like to spend on a ticket.
  Then, with the help of the Tequila/Kiwi API, I extract the cheapest flight I can find starting from tomorrow up to 6 months ahead. I've set the vacation in that city to be between 7-28 days, so the flights will appear within these margins. 
  Also, the flights will be direct; 
  I tried to somehow obtain flights with layovers, but I noticed that it's quite inconsistent in the program because for some cities, it offers layovers, while for others where layover flights exist, it doesn't. I tend to believe that such a problem is primarily from the airlines and not necessarily from my code. In the end, if the price of a flight is lower than the maximum amount of money I'm willing to spend, I'll receive a message on my phone and email. 
  Also, the project can be improved in terms of user input because I currently enter emails from the keyboard into the spreadsheet, and people who access this program, and my program only deals with extracting those users.
